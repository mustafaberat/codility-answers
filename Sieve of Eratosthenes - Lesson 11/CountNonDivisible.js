/*You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].*/


function solution(A) {
    const lenOfA = A.length
    const counters = Array(lenOfA * 2 + 1).fill(0)
    for (let j = 0; j < lenOfA; j++) counters[A[j]]++;

    return A.map(number => {
        let nonDivisor = lenOfA
        for (let i = 1; i * i <= number; i++) {
            if (number % i !== 0) continue;
            nonDivisor -= counters[i];
            if (i * i !== number) nonDivisor -= counters[number / i]
        }
        return nonDivisor
    })
}




/* FIRST LOOK - Not optimal for large array
function solution(A) {
    result = [], counter = 0;
    for(let number of A){
        for(let number2 of A){
            if(number % number2 !== 0){
                counter++;
            }
        }
        result.push(counter);
        counter = 0;
    }
    return result
 }
